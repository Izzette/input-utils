# input-utils

Set of basic utility methods that wrap the Java scanner class and provide simple methods for

*   Getting validated integer and double input from user.
*   Getting positive integer or double input from user.
*   Turning yes/no responses into boolean values
*   String input - doesn't do much more than the basic scanner.nextLine(), but there for consistency
